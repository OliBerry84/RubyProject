My first project on my coding journey! 

A brief of creating a Record Store Managers Console to control stock levels with added extension of working out profit and loss on total sales.

Using Ruby language and Sinatra to develop the Console and some html and css to style.

Overall I was happy as this was my first project and it was nice to see a front end and what all of our code the previous few weeks was actually doing.
